				<br><h2> 𝔸𝔹𝕆𝕌𝕋 𝕄𝔼 ♡ </h2>
				<p> I've dedicated my life to art specifically painting and drawing and I give free tutorial sessions online specifically in my Discord for Beginner Painters/Artists. I specifically teach watercolor painting along with tutorials for simple shading, sketching, and some sketching hacks. I also teach some beginner makeup artists online on specifically pre shower makeup or just normal makeup, how to style, finding your style, clothing style, and anything else involving fashion. My mother told me that with painting and sketching along with fashion and style, I can use these elements to pursue my dream of going to Fashion and possibly an Art College too. I find comfort in these activities and decided to spread this comfort that I feel towards other people who probably need it in their life too. </p>
